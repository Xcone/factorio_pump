Version: 2.1.10
Date: 2025-05-17

    - Fix planning being cancelled due to "mixed resources", when tile-ghosts are in the selected area.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.9
Date: 2025-03-29
  Fixes:
    - Fix pressing the key 'Confirm window' (bound to 'E' by default) wouldn't continue the planning operation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.8
Date: 2024-12-03
  Features:
    - New pipe-planner is now the default. See notes of 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 for more info how it's different then the original.
    - Continue with partial pipe-plan if a resource couldn't be connectected (new planner only). Print a warning with coord to the player where the unplanned resource is. 
    - Added setting to still use the original planner. Note: If you have problems with the new planner, or prefer the layout of the original planner, you can use the original planner for a while. The old planner will be removed at some point, though. So leave a message on the mod-portal so I can improve the new planner before the old one is removed.

Date: 2024-12-02
  Changes:
    - Improved desicion-making for the new planner for where to put the branches and how extractors connect to them.

    - Post-planning pipe bury routine can now bury more of a pipe that has an up-front-planned pipe in it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.4
Date: 2024-11-26
  Features:
    - Added picker for which cover tile to use on meltable tiles. Option is only visible on surfaces where meltable tiles are applicable (Aquilo).
    - Experimental new pipe-planner. It's rewritten to be able to plan underground pipes up-front, and thus being better suited for planning larger/dense fields where the original planning would fail.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.3
Date: 2024-11-23

    - Build positions are tested if a default_cover_tile applies. If so, the tile is planned as well. This means landfill on water, foundation on lava, and ice-platform on ammonia.
    - Build positions are tested if they're meltable. If so, "concrete" is planned as well. ("concrete" is currently hardcoded, and might not work well together with some serious overhaul mods.)
  Fixes:
    - Undo now also includes the (planned) deconstructed entities.
