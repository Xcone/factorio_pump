Version: 2.1.5
Date: 2024-12-02

    - Improved desicion-making for the new planner for where to put the branches and how extractors connect to them.
    - Added A* fallback routine to the new planner in case an extractor cannot neatly connect to a branch.
    - Post-planning pipe bury routine can now bury more of a pipe that has an up-front-planned pipe in it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.4
Date: 2024-11-26
  Features:
    - Added picker for which cover tile to use on meltable tiles. Option is only visible on surfaces where meltable tiles are applicable (Aquilo).
    - Experimental new pipe-planner. It's rewritten to be able to plan underground pipes up-front, and thus being better suited for planning larger/dense fields where the original planning would fail.
    - Added setting to enable the new planner (disabled by default, until its better tested and more refined)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.3
Date: 2024-11-23

Version: 2.1.1
Date: 2024-11-12

    - Build positions are tested if a default_cover_tile applies. If so, the tile is planned as well. This means landfill on water, foundation on lava, and ice-platform on ammonia.
    - Build positions are tested if they're meltable. If so, "concrete" is planned as well. ("concrete" is currently hardcoded, and might not work well together with some serious overhaul mods.)
  Fixes:
    - Undo now also includes the (planned) deconstructed entities. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
