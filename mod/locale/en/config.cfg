[failure]
obstructed-pipe=P.U.M.P. was unable to layout the pipes. Clear area of obstructions (trees, rocks, water, other buildings, etc.)
missing-resource=P.U.M.P. did not find fluid resources in selected area.
mixed-resources=P.U.M.P. cannot mix resources. 
other-pipes-nearby=P.U.M.P. aborted, because there are other pipes present within the selected area.
extractor-must-be-square=P.U.M.P. planner can only handle square miners. The resource '__1__' only has rectangular shaped miner(s) available.
no-suitable-extractor=P.U.M.P. has no miner available for the resource '__1__'. Complete the necessary research first.
no-pipe=P.U.M.P. has no pipe available. Complete the necessary research first.
no-power-pole=P.U.M.P. has no electric-pole available. Complete the necessary research first.
no-suitable-power-pole=P.U.M.P. does not support big power-poles, and no small ones are available.
too-many-power-poles=P.U.M.P. has performed (too) many iterations to place power poles and has aborted the attempt.
too-many-heatpipe-groups=P.U.M.P. has performed (too) many iterations while placing heat pipes and has aborted the attempt.

pump-interface-with-module-inserter-mod=Insert modules
pump-ignore-research=Ignore research
pump-always-show=Always show build options menu

[mod-setting-description]
pump-interface-with-module-inserter-mod=When enabled, P.U.M.P. uses the the configuration of 'Module Inserter Extended' to add modules to the placed ghosts as well.
pump-ignore-research=When enabled, P.U.M.P. will include the option in the menu for miners and pipes that are not yet unlocked through research.
pump-always-show=When disabled, the menu only opens when new options are available, or when holding SHIFT while using P.U.M.P.. You can toggle this option from the mod-settings as well.
pump-max-beacons-per-extractor=Hard limit on the amound of beacons that can cover a single extractor. As additional beacons have diminishing returns, this setting can be used to prevent waste.
pump-min-extractors-per-beacon=Place your beacons where it really matters! If a beacon-position won't cover this amount of extractors, that position is not being considered in the planning.
pump-preferred-beacons-per-extractor=Stop planning for this extractor after this number of beacons for it is reached. Additional beacons might still be added in range as a side effect of planning for other extractors. The other 2 beacon related settings take precedence.
